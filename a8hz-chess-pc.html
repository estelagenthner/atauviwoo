The games was primarily chess, but when went to capture a piece you have to battle in a space dogfight if you lost they would capture your peice instead. I believe it came on a cd with multiple games. I would love to find this game because my brother and I spent hours playing together.

Mine was: "Don't make the PCs the heroes foretold in prophecy." It sounded cool, but the unforeseen trap occurred when a player quit the group and again when a character died in a random encounter. "Meet Wizard Mcpants II. Who knew? He's also a hero of prophecy. who was not mentioned until a few minutes ago.".

It looks like KS requested more proof of prototype from Fromaggio and they failed to comply (though they claim they missed the email).

The DMG gives some loose guidelines about "Tiers of Play:" 1-4 are local heroes, 5-10 are heroes of the realm, 11-16 are masters of the realm, and 17-20 are masters of the world. This is nice, but I had a more precise question I wanted the answer to: how many guys are running around the world who could do the same things as the heroes at any given level. In other words, how rare is a level 12 character going to be? To approach this, I used an analogue. In chess, players are given Background: Auto Chess is an extremely popular custom game for Dota 2, usually surpassing 200K concurrent players. For comparison, the total number of players in Dota 2 tends to be between 800K and 900K, and custom games rarely reach more than around 10K. Baumi is a Dota 2 Youtuber and streamer with very polarised community opinions. He's been involved in custom game related drama before when a custom game dev added a feature that crashed any game Baumi joined, (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2.

The rule of law DEMANDS action. Inaction is a failure. This slap of cold water really upset some of his followers I have never played DnD before, but after listening to several play podcasts I have been inspired to try it finally. None of my friends wanted to be DM so I took the task upon myself, and I am really excited to create a story for them. The themes and loose events of the campaign is a mix of Star Wars: KotOR, and LoZ: Orcarina of Time. But instead of space its an oceanic world with spacecraft replaces with ships, and islands replacing planets. I would I recently got the ludoplex and I like it's games and all, though since I'm on my pc I find myself playing fortuna/sorties/arbitrations and other various missions and end up forgetting about it's existence most of the time. The games on it seem to be possible to be played on a mobile device, having an app that would allow us to access and play games on our ludoplex would be amazing for many reasons: More players in frame fighter. Ability to still play in game and gain credits without All this talk about the DotA chess reminded me that there was a magic chess-style game I played a lot back in middle school. It was a very dark atmosphere with a game board with stone-like pieces and they had different magic powers. Some pieces had to be purchased to be unlocked for play. I believe it was browser based but I really don't 
Gil, Gruth, Valzif, Rolan, Balor, beware. Last night in our CoS session the party came across a home brewed baddie for the second time. He was the BBEG’s right hand man and was bound by duty and honor to serve him. Besides that, he was really a cool dude. He didn’t like to be caught up in all the drama that was the campaign and told the party they’d probably be friends if things were different. But alas, he was bound to Strahd and told the party that should the day come, he would stand again. I’m planning out my group’s next campaign, and the supervillain is someone who is themed around chessboxing. 1 v 1, 1 round chess, 1 round boxing. Repeat until checkmate or T/KO I’m trying to figure out the logistics of how to do an encounter like this. Mainly, how to do a round a chess. I understand how to get them 1 v1, and fighting, but the chess alludes me. Would it be something like 10 opposed intelligence checks or something? Or does this sound too convoluted? Here’s 'Tower of the Stargazer' by Lamentations of the Flame Princess is really good. Can anyone recommend any others? From any system or any edition of Dungeons and Dragons? 3-6 hourse play time is what I'm thinking. I am rated 1200 on lichess but I only play to have fun. I used to play games like Counter Strike, League of Legends, etc. but now I only play chess. I understand that chess is a game but it makes a big difference when I can play a game that lasts 1, 3 or 5 minutes rather than being sucked into games which last an hour and usually make me want to keep playing more. This is particularly helpful seeing as I am an electrical engineering student and I work so time is a very valuable thing I'm considering making a full-size, life and death chess game in my campaign (similar to the one on Harry Potter) and was wondering if you guys had any ideas on how to make dragonchess more interesting and exiting that normal chess? Thanks, and feel free to steal my idea. Edit: Woah! So many comments! Thanks. Doing a quick check, it seems people have suggested lichess and chess.com. Is 1 better than the other? Is using both unnecessary? Any strong Chess PC program (installed/online) or phone app that can tutor you with recommended moves as you play? Also what is the average FIDE rating that a player can get to after a year and what's the best rating you've seen a player achieve after a year? Note: I know the rules of Chess and have experience with and am more than decent at playing Chinese Chess. Fairly new GM here. I usually just make up die pools to roll against my players to cut the prep work down and allow me to change or add things on the fly as I have quite a chaotic party. I do have some ideas for more substantial upcoming threats. What is the best way to make rivals or “bosses” to go against the players? Should I use the character generation rules as if for a player. 
Out of all my friends and classmates, i hardly anyone plays anything more than Smash or battleroyals. My steam library is glorious, but i have had to play many multiplayer games Han style, Solo. Still, I spend most of my free time exploring the vast universe that is gaming, even if i have to do it alone. I play R6 siege, Minecraft, and more, been really wanting to play Division 2, but no one i know has it, same with 7days, DBD, The forest, Arizona sunshine VR, Dont starve together  World Championship winning computer chess software programs and downloads for chess database, analysis and chess play on PC, Mac, iPhone PC Chess Software: HIARCS Chess Explorer for PC Windows computer chess software programs.
